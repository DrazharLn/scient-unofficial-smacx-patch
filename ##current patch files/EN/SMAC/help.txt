^$LINK<Democratic=120003>
^$LINK<Fundamentalist=120004>

#;Frontier
#HELPSOC00
Frontier politics represent the informal governing arrangements made
in early colonies, before populations reach levels requiring more
advanced forms of government. Frontier politics provides no bonuses
or penalties.
^
^Prerequisite: NONE

#;Police State
#HELPSOC01
Police States use oppression to keep their citizens in line, and allow
their leaders great power over military decisions. But oppression of
this type also decreases economic efficiency.
^
+2 POLICE
+2 SUPPORT
-2 EFFICIENCY
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Democratic
#HELPSOC02
Democracies allow citizens to participate in government, and forego
oppression and the stability it confers in favor of growth and efficiency.
But citizens remain suspicious of large military deployments, and civilian
oversight creates large military bureaucracies, so military support
costs increase.
^

^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Fundamentalist
#HELPSOC03
Fundamentalist politics unite a society behind a strong, dogmatic
religion. Evangelizing the populace can create loyal, even fanatical
military forces, and tends to immunize citizens against (other forms
of) brainwashing, but technological research tends to suffer under the
continual assaults on intellectual integrity associated with such
regimes.

^$LINK<Planned=120008>
^$LINK<Green=120009>

#;Simple
#HELPSOC10
Simple Economics describes the informal, ad hoc economy which develops
in the early years of planetfall, before more organized economic
systems can be put in place. Simple Economics provides no special
benefits or penalties.
^
^Prerequisite: NONE

#;Free Market
#HELPSOC11
Free Market Economics turns market forces loose in your society.
Unfettered market economics can produce great wealth quickly, but
in the context of Planet’s fragile emerging economies can also lead
to extremes of pollution and ecological damage. Also, citizens rendered
suddenly poor by the actions unscrupulous moguls may revolt against
their energy-fattened masters.

+2 ECONOMY
-3 PLANET
-5 POLICE
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Planned
#HELPSOC12
A semi-market economy kept in check by fierce governmental regulation,
Planned Economics promotes stable industrial and population growth, but
sacrifices efficiency.
^
+2 GROWTH
+1 INDUSTRY
-2 EFFICIENCY
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Green
#HELPSOC13
Green Economics strive to integrate human progress with the needs
of the biosphere. Green economies use resources efficiently and
tend to avoid the excesses of industrial development which could
provoke Planet’s native life, but population growth necessarily
suffers for lack of space.

#HELPSOC20
Survival is of course the all-encompassing first priority of early
human space colonies. “Survival” as a priority provides no
special bonuses or penalties.
^
^Prerequisite: NONE

enforce their will. But Economic and industrial infrastructure may
suffer from bloated “defense” budgets.

#HELPSOC22
Leaders seeking Knowledge and intellectual enlightenment will pour
resources into research and education. They will also tend to promote
the free exchange of information, which increases efficiency but also
carries greater security risks.
^
+2 RESEARCH
+1 EFFICIENCY
-2 PROBE

#HELPSOC31
In the far future, citizens may turn many of the tasks of governing
society over to artificially intelligent computers, increasing
efficiency and freeing humans for more creative tasks. But will
workers displaced by computers sink into despair, poverty, and
possible unrest?

#;Eudiamonic
#HELPSOC32
Perhaps the most pleasant to contemplate living in, this far future
society takes its name from an ancient Greek word for fulfillment
and happiness. Eudaimonic society encourages each citizen to achieve
happiness through striving to fulfill completely his or her potential.
Population, Economy, and Industry all experience healthy growth.
Violence fades as society grows more tolerant and just, and even when
this society’s hand is forced it often shoots to subdue rather than
to destroy.

Your Terraforming Engineers (“FORMERS”) are crucial to your
expedition’s survival. Formers can plant $LINK<forests=90004> and
$LINK<farms=90000>; build $LINK<roads=90005>, $LINK<mines=90002>,
and $LINK<solar collectors=90003>; and even $LINK<raise up=90016>
or $LINK<tear down mountains=90017>.

#UNITDESC2
A {Scout Patrol} can be used to explore the unknown regions of Planet.
It can also be used to guard bases from attack by enemies and
$LINK<mind worms=30008>, though it is not as powerful as later military
units which can be developed.

#UNITDESC3
{Transport Foils} are a useful early means of transportation between
continents and oceans. Land units can be loaded onto Transport Foils
and moved by sea.

#UNITDESC4

and reshape Planet. Sea Formers can plant $LINK<Kelp Farms=90020>, build
$LINK<Mining Platforms=90022>, and construct $LINK<Tidal Harnesses=90023>.

#UNITDESC5
{Supply Crawlers} are useful for transporting resources.
Supply Crawlers may:
^
* Produce $LINK<nutrients=41>, $LINK<minerals=42>, or $LINK<energy=43> from any
square on the map and send the resources to its home base.
Select the “Convoy” (‘O’) option on the Action Menu.
^
* Disband themselves in a friendly base to yield their {full} mineral
value towards the construction of a $LINK<secret project=110071> or
$LINK<unit prototype=23>.

#UNITDESC6
{Probe Teams} can infiltrate and subvert enemy bases and units. They can
also steal enemy research information, sabotage base facilities,
assassinate key enemy personnel, and conduct genetic warfare.
^
Move a probe team up to an enemy base or unit to engage its powers.
^
Probe teams can also defend your bases against their enemy counterparts.
If a probe team is present in a square when an enemy probe team tries
to enter, a combat is resolved between them. The probe team with the
highest $LINK<morale=11> level usually wins.
^
Probe teams often receive morale increases when they complete missions
successfully. The higher a probe team’s morale level, the more likely
it is to survive increasingly more complex missions.

#UNITDESC7
{Artifacts} are mysterious and unexplained alien devices sometimes discovered
on Planet. If you can find an artifact and return it to one of your bases, you
will have several options: (a) you can link it to a $LINK<Network Node=100008>
if you have one, and receive a free technology breakthrough;
(b) you can use it to speed the production of a $LINK<Secret Project=110071>
or $LINK<Unit Prototype=23>; (c) you can save it to use later.
^
Artifacts can be captured from other players. A lone artifact can be captured by
any player without diplomatic penalty.

#UNITDESC8
{Mind Worms} can appear suddenly, and are closely associated with
$LINK<fungus=14>.
^
Mind Worms and other alien creatures can engage in $LINK<Psi Combat=15>,
in which weapon and armor strengths are ignored, and the attacker
is given a 3 to 2 advantage on land. $LINK<Morale=11> level is quite important
in defending against Mind Worms and other alien units.
^
With proper breeding and bonding techniques, Mind Worms can also be bred
in captivity and controlled by skilled brood trainers. These Mind Worm
boils can be used to attack enemy units using Psi Combat, thus bypassing
enemy advantages in weapon and armor technology.  $LINK<Biology Labs=100009>
and other facilities can increase the strength of captivity-bred Mind Worm
boils.

#UNITDESC9
An aquatic vector of the $LINK<Mind Worms=30008>, the {Isle of the Deep}
is closely associated with Mind Worms and $LINK<Sea Fungus=14>.
The floating shell of an Isle of the Deep, formed by the secretions
of the colony’s individual
members, is often used as a nesting place by Mind Worms, and can even
float large land units.
^
Isles of the Deep and other alien creatures can engage in $LINK<Psi Combat=15>,
in which weapon and armor strengths are ignored.
$LINK<Morale=11> level is quite important in defending against
Isles of the Deep and other alien units.
^
With proper breeding and bonding techniques, Isles of the Deep can
also be bred in captivity and controlled by skilled brood trainers.
These captive boils can be used to attack enemy naval units using Psi
Combat. Depending on their size, they can also be used to transport
land units.

#UNITDESC10
Planet’s fiercest avatars, the {Locusts of Chiron} are a ravenous winged
variation the land-bound $LINK<Mind Worms=30008>. The appearance of Locusts

advantages in battle. Infantry units gain a +25% combat advantage
when attacking enemy bases directly.

#CHASSISDESC1
Mobile {Speeder} units can move quickly across Planet’s surface.
Speeder units gain a +25% combat advantage when attacking in
open terrain. They can also disengage from combat when surprised
by slower enemy $LINK<infantry.=40000>

#CHASSISDESC2
The ultimate in ground effect transportation, the {Hovertank}
is never penalized for moving through difficult terrain—it
never costs more than one move for a Hovertank to enter a square.
Like $LINK<Speeder=40001> units, Hovertanks gain a +25% combat advantage when
attacking in open terrain.

#CHASSISDESC3
{Foils} can be used to create effective sea transports and
sea patrols.

#CHASSISDESC4
With sufficient industrial infrastructure, large {Cruiser} units
can be produced. These larger vessels make formidable naval units
as well as the most efficient transports.

#CHASSISDESC5
{Needlejets}, the signature aircraft of the 23rd century, appear in
Planet’s skies once Planet’s growing industries begin producing
high grade jet fuel in sufficient quantities. Powerful, but limited
in range, Needlejets can be used to defend the skies, project air power,
and explore Planet.
^
Needlejets must return to a friendly base or airbase every other turn
for refueling.

#CHASSISDESC6
{Copters}, with their maneuverability and ability to land temporarily
in rough terrain, make formidable combat units.
^
Copters should return to a friendly base or airbase at the end of
every turn for refueling. If it is unable to do so and must land
temporarily in the field, it incurs 30% damage.

#CHASSISDESC7
{Gravships}, the juggernauts of the distant future, provide all the
advantages of aircraft with none of the range limitations. Gravships
can move swiftly over land and sea, and need never return to friendly
bases for refueling.

#CHASSISDESC8
{Missiles} can be used to mount powerful $LINK<conventional payloads=60020> or
spectacular quasi-nuclear $LINK<Planet Busters=60013>. Missiles pack a powerful
punch, but are of course eliminated when they attack.

The {Psi Attack} weapon allows a conventional unit to make Psi
attacks. Weapons and armor are ignored in $LINK<Psi Combat=15>, and the
attacker receives a 3 to 2 advantage on land (1 to 1 at sea).

#WEAPONDESC13
The quasi-nuclear {Planet Buster} is future humanity’s ultimate
atrocity. Planet Busters destroy everything within a radius equal
to their $LINK<reactor=50001> size, often leaving immense craters.
^
Under the U.N. Charter, use of Planet Busters is punishable by
immediate expulsion from the $LINK<Planetary Council=27> and total military
destruction.

#WEAPONDESC14
The {Colony Module} can be used to create custom $LINK<Colony Pods=30000>.

is installed on a sea-going unit, bases can be constructed at sea.

#WEAPONDESC15
The {Terraforming Unit} can be used to create custom $LINK<terraformers=30001>.

#WEAPONDESC16
The {Troop Transport} module allows a unit to transport other units
by land, sea, or air, depending on the unit’s chassis.
^
Only sea-going units can transport more than one unit at a time.
A {Foil} can transport a number of units equal to twice its reactor
value. A {Cruiser} can transport a number of units equal to four
times its reactor value.
^
Transports can normally transport only ground units, but seagoing
transports can be given the $LINK<Carrier Deck=80007> special ability to
allow them to transport and refuel air units.

#WEAPONDESC17
The {Supply Transport} module can be used to create custom supply
units. Such units function much as $LINK<Supply Crawlers=30005>, and can:
^
* Produce nutrients, minerals, or energy from any square on the map
and send the resources to its home base.
Select the “Convoy” (‘O’) option on the Action Menu.
^
* Disband themselves in a friendly base to yield their {full} mineral
value towards the construction of a secret project or unit prototype.

#WEAPONDESC18
The {Probe Team} module can be used to create custom probe teams.
Such units function much as regular $LINK<Probe Teams=30006>.

Probe teams can also defend your bases against their enemy counterparts.
If a probe team is present in a square when an enemy probe team tries
to enter, a combat is resolved between them. The probe team with the
highest $LINK<morale=11> level usually wins.
^
Probe teams often receive morale increases when they complete missions
successfully. The higher a probe team’s morale level, the more likely
it is to survive increasingly more complex missions.

away.
^
^Domain: All
^Desc.: Mk. 45 Sensor array upgrade

#ABILDESC2
A {Cloaking Device} allows a unit to avoid detection by enemy units
unless they actually attempt to enter the same square. Cloaked units
may also ignore enemy $LINK<Zones of Control=34>—they may move freely between
squares adjacent to enemy units.

{Amphibious Pods} allow a ground unit to attack directly from a sea
square when disembarking from a transport. Units with Amphibious Pods
may also move and attack across the channels between Sea Bases and
continents.
^
^Domain: Land
^Desc: Hoverpod LCs
^Limits: Combat units only

#ABILDESC4
{Drop Pods} allow ground units to make air drops. A unit must begin
its turn in a friendly base or airbase in order to make an airdrop.
Airdrops may be made into any empty square within 8 squares (unless
your faction has the technology necessary to make Orbital Insertions,
in which case units may be dropped anywhere on the planet).
^
Drop Pod units may move after an airdrop, but if they attack a
50% combat penalty applies.

#ABILDESC5
The {Air Superiority} ability equips a unit with the missiles necessary
to attack Needlejets in flight. Air Superiority units gain a +100%
combat advantage when attacking other air units in flight, but incur
a -50% penalty if they attack ground or naval units.
^
Air-to-air combat is resolved by comparing attack factors—the armor
value is ignored.
^
Note that even ground and naval units can be equipped with the SAM
missiles necessary to confer this ability.
^
^Domain: All
^Desc: Mk. 66 fire control sensor

^Domain: Land, Sea
^Desc.: Mk. 190 FUBR fire control system
^Limits: Not for use with Psi or air units

#ABILDESC9
The {Comm Jammer} ability interferes with enemy tactical command and
control, thus throwing enemy mobile offensives into confusion. A Comm
Jammer confers a +50% defense bonus against ground units with more
than one move ($LINK<Speeders=40001> and $LINK<Hovertanks=40002>).
^
^Domain: Land
^Desc.: Type IX ECTS EMP pulse generator
^Limits: Combat, non-Psi units only

#ABILDESC10
{Antigrav Struts} give a unit an extra move each turn, and allow all
ground units, like $LINK<Hovertanks=40002>, to avoid movement penalties
for difficult terrain.
^
Air units with Antigrav Struts gain moves equal to twice their reactor
value (so an Antigrav air unit with a $LINK<Fusion reactor=50002>
would gain 4 moves).
^
^Domain: Land, Air
^Desc.: Gravitron repulsor pylons
^Limits: None

#ABILDESC11
The {Empath Song} ability confers a +50% attack bonus against units
which employ a Psi Defense, such as $LINK<Mind Worms=30008>
and other alien creatures.
^
^Domain: All
^Desc.: Psi lock software upgrade
^Limits: Non-psi combat units only

#ABILDESC13
{Fungicide Tanks} allows a terraformer unit to clear $LINK<Xenofungus=14>
at twice the normal rate. Only $LINK<terraforming=30001> units can use this
ability.
^
^Domain: All
^Desc.: Boron defoliant system
^Limits: Terraformer units only

The {High Morale} ability gives a unit a $LINK<+1 morale=11> upgrade when it
is first created.
^
^Domain: All
^Desc.: Advanced Warfare Training
^Limits: Combat units only

#ABILDESC15
{Heavy Artillery} units bombard their targets from a distance rather
than attacking them directly. This unique ability allows them to fire
at units up to two squares away, and to attack every unit in a square
with one attack.
^
An artillery unit’s only weakness is its inability to attack by
any other means than $LINK<bombardment=35>.
^
Note that naval units have the intrinsic ability to conduct
bombardment, but they may also attack directly against units in
sea squares.

defenses ($LINK<Perimeter Defense=100004>, $LINK<Tachyon Field=100005>)
when attacking.
^
^Domain: All
^Desc.: Temporal distortion field
^Limits: Combat units only

#ABILDESC18
Units with the {Hypnotic Trance} ability are insulated from Psi
attack, and thus receive a +50% defense bonus when attacked by
units which employ $LINK<Psi Combat=15>, such as $LINK<Mind Worms=30008>
and other alien creatures.
^
^Domain: All
^Desc.: Psychic amplification module
^Limits: Non-psi combat units only

#ABILDESC20
Faction leaders willing to commit atrocities can equip their combat
units with {Nerve Gas Pods.} Units so equipped can employ these pods
to gain a +50% attack bonus. If employed against a populated area,
Nerve Gas Pods will cause significant civilian casualties.
