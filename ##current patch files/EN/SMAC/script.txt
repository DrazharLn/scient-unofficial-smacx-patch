; INSTRUCTIONS FOR TRANSLATORS!
;
; 1) These files must not be saved in “Microsoft Word Format”, or they will
;    be ruined. They MUST be saved in “Text Only” format.
;
; 2) Please do not insert extra blank lines, nor remove existing blank
;    lines, as this will cause the program to malfunction.
;
; 3) But it is normally okay to turn a long line into two shorter lines;
;    for instance:
;
;    This is a very long sentence; it probably won’t fit on one line in German.
;
;                       is equivalent to:
;
;    This is a very long sentence; It probably
;    won’t fit on one line in German.
;
; 4) It is also okay to have lines be pretty much as long as they need
;    to be off the edge of the screen (up to, say, 150-200 characters
;    long.
;
; 5) Lines beginning with “#” are control lines, and the FIRST WORD
;    immediately following the # should NOT be translated. Subsequent
;    words on the line SHOULD be translated. For example:
;
;    #caption Hello
;         to
;    #caption Bonjour
;
;    #button Yes
;         to
;    #button Oui
;
; 6) The “{” and “}” characters are used to indicate text which should
;    be displayed in BOLD type. The “[” and “]” characters indicate
;    text which should be displayed in ITALIC type. A {} sequence or
;    a [] sequence can begin and end on different lines.
;
; 7) Lines beginning with “^” begin on new lines.
;
; 8) Lines beginning with “^^” are centered.
;
; 9) The “$” character indicates a string is to be substituted. The
;    $ is followed by the name and ID of the string, as in:
;
;    Greetings, $PLAYERNAME1.
;
;    In this case, the ID of the string is 1. The name of the string
;    is for informational purposes only, so $PLAYERNAME1, $NAME1,
;    $STRING1, and $WHOZIT1 are all equivalent. The names themselves
;    do NOT need to be translated, although translating them won’t
;    cause harm as long as the numerical ID is left alone (except in
;    the case below).
;
;    An important EXCEPTION is that $NUM0 (or $NUM1, $NUM2, etc)
;    indicate a numerical value is to be displayed, and $HEX0 $HEX1,
;    etc indicate a hexadecimal value will be displayed. “NUM” and
;    “HEX” must NOT be translated or their special meaning will be lost.
;
; 10) Sequences enclosed in < > angle brackets are used to perform
;     gender and plurality substitutions.
;
;     $<…> sequences must BEGIN AND END ON THE SAME LINE!
;
;     Here are the substitution forms, followed by some examples:
;
; $FACTION3          = Substitute string 3
; $<3:has:have>      = Substitute based on plurality of string 3
; $<3:le:la:les:les> = Substitute based on plurality & gender of string 3
; $<3:masc:fem:neut:pmasc:pfem:pneut> = plurality & gender, includes neuter
; $<3:$FACTIONADJ4>  = Inserts string 4 and parses based on
;                      plurality & gender of string 3.
; $<M1:$FACTIONADJ4> = Inserts string 4 and parses for the
;                      masculine singular form.
; $<F2:$FACTIONADJ4> = … Feminine plural, etc.
;
; Since English doesn’t have have the exciting masculine/feminine
; problem, and no plural problem for “the”, there will be cases where
; YOU THE TRANSLATOR will have to add sequences of this type. For
; example, you can convert the following sentences (For “faction”,
; imagine substituting any of “University”, “Gaians”, etc)
;
; The $FACTION4 $<4:has:have> …
;
; into:
;
; $<4:Le:La:Les:Les> $FACTION4 $<4:a:ont> …
;
; and convert …
;
; $TITLE0 $NAME1 of the $FACTION2
;
; into:
;
; $TITLE0 $NAME1 $<2:du:de la:des:des> $FACTION2
;
; Note that the “4:” or “2:” is important as it tells the computer which word
; in the sentence to take its gender/plurality from (there are often
; several substitutions in a paragraph).
;
; FRENCH translators note that the program will AUTOMATICALLY handle
; the L’ and D’ contractions for le, la, and de.
;
; 11. English also doesn’t have adjective gender/plurality
; issues (rah rah English!) which means you’ll need to correct
; those as you go along. There are two basic situations you’ll
; encounter. The first is adjectives present in the text and
; used to modify words being substituted in:
;
; the pretty $ITEM3 that $NAME4 …
;
; which you can convert to:
;
; $<3:le:la:les:les> $ITEM3 $<3:bel:belle:bels:belles> que $NAME4 …
;
; Again the “3:” reminds the computer to substitute based on the
; plurality and gender of $ITEM3 rather than (for instance) $NAME4.
;
; The other situation you’ll encounter is where an ADJECTIVE is being
; substituted in to modify words present in the text:
;
; $<M1:$FACTIONADJ0> sisters …
;
; The “M1” calls for a masculine singular substitution (remember,
; English doesn’t have this problem so I’ve set everything to the
; default). Obviously “sisters” is neither masculine nor singular,
; so you’ll want to call for the feminine plural form:
;
; soeurs $<F2:$FACTIONADJ0> …
;
; 12. GERMAN translators can do the same thing, and simply use
;     $<…> sequences with SIX items to take care of neuter forms.
;     Unfortunately I don’t know any German at all, so I can’t give
;     you any good examples.

$NAME3, a new era of struggle and opportunity awaits you. The
U.N. Starship Unity has arrived in the Alpha Centauri system
after a forty year voyage. All contact with Earth has been
lost. After Captain Garland’s assassination by an unknown assailant,
the crew mutinied and split into factions. In the ensuing conflict, some seized
control of the Unity’s colony pods. You now shape the destiny of
your $<M1:$FACTIONADJ0> faction, which has just made {planetfall}!

Remember that map area increases geometrically as horizontal and
vertical sizes increase. Maps larger than 64×128 are not really
recommended; maps larger than 256×256 may cause the game
to “hang” indefinitely. Enormous maps which also contain huge world
spanning continents are particularly problematic for performance,
because of the variations created for the pathfinding code.

Just between us, I find that those Progenitors make the skin

say. As long as the $FACTION4 leave me and mine alone, I’m willing to
do the same. Speaking of which, I have a nice

I’d be happy to exchange for your information on {$TECH6}.”
