##Opening Quotation
#OPENING
Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden.
He drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden
of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to
keep the way of the tree of life.
^
^       —The Conclave Bible,
^        Datalinks

##Biogenetics
#TECH0
We hold life to be sacred, but we also know the foundation of life
consists in a stream of codes not so different from the successive
frames of a watchvid. Why then cannot we cut one code short here, and
start another there? Is life so fragile that it can withstand no
tampering? Does the sacred brook no improvement?
^
^       —Chairman Sheng-ji Yang,
^       “Dynamics of Mind”

##Industrial Base
#TECH1
Resources exist to be consumed. And consumed they will be, if not by
this generation then by some future. By what right does this forgotten
future seek to deny us our birthright? None I say! Let us take what is
ours, chew and eat our fill.
^
^       —CEO Nwabudike Morgan,
^       “The Ethics of Greed”

##Information Networks
#TECH2
The righteous need not cower before the drumbeat of human progress.
Though the song of yesterday fades into the challenge of tomorrow,
God still watches and judges us. Evil lurks in the datalinks as it
lurked in the streets of yesteryear. But it was never the streets
that were evil.
^
^       —Sister Miriam Godwinson,
^       “The Blessed Struggle”

##Applied Physics
#TECH3
Scientific theories are judged by the coherence they lend to our
natural experience and the simplicity with which they do so. The
grand principle of the heavens balances on the razor’s edge of truth.
^
^       —Commissioner Pravin Lal,
^       “A History of Science”

##Social Psych
#TECH4
If you can discover a better way of life than office-holding
for your future rulers, a well-governed city becomes a possibility.
For only in such a state will those rule who are truly rich, not
in gold, but in the wealth that makes happiness—a good and wise
life.
^       —Plato,
^       “The Republic”, Datalinks

##Doctrine: Mobility
#TECH5
Once a man has changed the relationship between himself and his
environment, he cannot return to the blissful ignorance he left.
Motion, of necessity, involves a change in perspective.
^
^       —Commissioner Pravin Lal,
^       “A Social History of Planet”

##Centauri Ecology
#TECH6
Planet’s atmosphere, though a gasping death to humans and most animals,
is paradise for Earth plants. The high nitrate content of the soil and
the rich yellow sunlight bring an abundant harvest wherever
adjustments can be made for the unusual soil conditions.
^
^       —Lady Deirdre Skye,
^       “A Comparative Biology of Planet”

##Superconductor
#TECH7
Important? Yes! Critical? Absolutely. I would go so far as to say
that Superconducting Fiber alone makes our present economy possible.
^
^       —CEO Nwabudike Morgan,
^        MorganLink 3DVision Live Interview

##Nonlinear Mathematics
#TECH8
There are two kinds of scientific progress: the methodical
experimentation and categorization which gradually extend the
boundaries of knowledge, and the revolutionary leap of genius
which redefines and transcends those boundaries. Acknowledging
our debt to the former, we yearn nonetheless for the latter.
^
^       —Academician Prokhor Zakharov,
^       “Address to the Faculty”

##Applied Relativity
#TECH9
You ivory tower intellectuals must not lose touch with the world
of industrial growth and hard currency. It is all very well and
good to pursue these high-minded scientific theories, but research
grants are expensive and you must justify your existence by providing
not only knowledge, but concrete and profitable applications as well.
^
^       —CEO Nwabudike Morgan,
^       “The Ethics of Greed”

##Fusion Power
#TECH10
Our ancestors harnessed the power of a sun, and so again shall we.
^
^       —Commissioner Pravin Lal,
^       “The Science of Our Fathers”

##Silksteel Alloys
#TECH11
Until quite recently, spider silk had the highest tensile strength
of any substance known to man, and the name Silksteel pays homage
to the arachnid for good reason.
^
^       —Commissioner Pravin Lal,
^       “U.N. Scientific Survey”

##Advanced Subatomic Theory
#TECH12
The substructure of the universe regresses infinitely towards
smaller and smaller components. Behind atoms we find electrons,
and behind electrons quarks. Each layer unraveled reveals new
secrets, but also new mysteries.
^
^       —Academician Prokhor Zakharov,
^       “For I Have Tasted The Fruit”

##High Energy Chemistry
#TECH13
At atrociously high energy states, the properties of matter
change subtly and new miracles become possible. The Plasma
Accretion process is now dangerous and difficult to control, but
its products will soon become commonplace in our society.
^
^       —Sister Miriam Godwinson,
^       “The Lord Works”

##Frictionless Surfaces
#TECH14
As I stepped onto the Magtube, a thought struck me:
Can there be friction where there is no substance?
And can substance be tricked into hiding from itself?
^
^       —Dr. Gayle Nambala,
^        Morgan Industries Researcher

##Nanometallurgy
#TECH15
Our scientists now use fractal theory to “teach” the molecules to
assume, or resume, a particular form. Substances of amazing
strength become simple once the formulae are properly computed.
^
^       —Colonel Corazon Santiago,
^       “The Council of War”

##Superstring Theory
#TECH16
A brave little theory, and actually quite coherent for a system of
five or seven dimensions—if only we lived in one.
^
^       —Academician Prokhor Zakharov,
^       “Now We Are Alone”

##Advanced Military Algorithms
#TECH17
Man has killed man from the beginning of time, and each new frontier
has brought new ways and new places to die. Why should the future
be different?
^
^       —Colonel Corazon Santiago,
^       “Planet: A Survivalist’s Guide”

##Monopole Magnets
#TECH18
I maintain nonetheless that yin-yang dualism can be overcome.
With sufficient enlightenment we can give substance to any
distinction: mind without body, north without south, pleasure
without pain. Remember, enlightenment is a function of willpower,
not of physical strength.
^
^       —Chairman Sheng-ji Yang,
^       “Essays on Mind and Matter”

##Matter Compression
#TECH19
Preliminary analysis indicates that our rivals have developed
a safe and reliable method to simulate conditions existing on the
interior of a stellar mass. The fabrication and transmutation
of materials possible in such an environment guarantees significant
industrial and military applications.
^
^       —Probe Team Operations Directorate,
^        Top Secret Report

##Unified Field Theory
#TECH20
Beware, you who seek first and final principles, for you are
trampling the garden of an angry God and he awaits you just
beyond the last theorem.
^
^       —Sister Miriam Godwinson,
^       “But for the Grace of God”

##Graviton Theory
#TECH21
This unusual specimen is not so much a classic particle as a
connector—a kind of string attaching two particles. As distance
increases the connective power becomes attenuated, but if it is
cut the power vanishes: forever.
^
^       —Academician Prokhor Zakharov,
^       “For I Have Tasted The Fruit”

##Polymorphic Software
#TECH22
Technological advance is an inherently iterative process.
One does not simply take sand from the beach and produce a Dataprobe.
We use crude tools to fashion better tools, and then our better
tools to fashion more precise tools, and so on. Each minor refinement
is a step in the process, and all of the steps must be taken.
^
^       —Chairman Sheng-ji Yang,
^       “Looking God in the Eye”

##Applied Gravitonics
#TECH23
“What goes up … better doggone well stay up!”
^
^       —Morgan Gravitonics,
^        Company Slogan

##Inertial Damping
#TECH24
Until now the battle had been proceeding smoothly: the enemy
was outflanked and had been driven from the reactor housing. But
against the reactor itself the matter cannon were strangely
ineffective. Rounds simply … stopped. In mid-air.
^
^       —Colonel Corazon Santiago,
^       “A Tactical History of Sparta”

##Quantum Power
#TECH25
^^Heaven lasts long, and Earth abides
^^What is the secret of their durability?
^^Is it because they do not live for themselves
^^That they endure so long?
^
^       —Lao Tzu, Datalinks

##Singularity Mechanics
#TECH26
Yes, yes, we’ve all heard the philosophers babble about “oneness”
being “beautiful” and “holy”. But let me tell you that {this} kind
of oneness certainly isn’t pretty and if you’re not careful it
will scare the bejeezus out of you.
^
^       —Anonymous Lab Technician,
^        MorganLink 3DVision Live Interview

##Controlled Singularity
#TECH27
Some would ask, how could a perfect God create a universe filled
with so much that is evil. They have missed a greater conundrum:
why would a perfect God create a universe at all?
^
^       —Sister Miriam Godwinson,
^       “But for the Grace of God”

##Temporal Mechanics
#TECH28
Time travel in the classic sense has no place in rational theory,
but temporal distortion does exist on the quantum level, and more
importantly it can be controlled.
^
^       —Academician Prokhor Zakharov,
^       “For I Have Tasted The Fruit”

##Probability Mechanics
#TECH29
Einstein would turn over in his grave. Not only does God play
dice, the dice are loaded.
^
^       —Chairman Sheng-ji Yang,
^       “Looking God in the Eye”

##Pre-Sentient Algorithms
#TECH30
Begin with a function of arbitrary complexity. Feed it values,
“sense data”. Then, take your result, square it, and feed it back
into your original function, adding a new set of sense data.
Continue to feed your results back into the original function ad
infinitum. What do you have? The fundamental principle of human
consciousness.
^
^       —Academician Prokhor Zakharov,
^       “The Feedback Principle”

##Super Tensile Solids
#TECH31
Optical computers, genetic catalogs, nanorepair modules—forget
all of that. It’s when you see a megaton of steel suspended over
your head by a thread the thickness of a human hair that you
really find God in technology.
^
^       —Anonymous Metagenics Dockworker,
^        MorganLink 3DVision Live Interview

##Planetary Networks
#TECH32
If our society seems more nihilistic than that of previous eras, perhaps
this is simply a sign of our maturity as a sentient species. As our
collective consciousness expands beyond a crucial point, we are
at last ready to accept life’s fundamental truth: that life’s only
purpose is life itself.
^
^       —Chairman Sheng-ji Yang,
^       “Looking God in the Eye”

##Digital Sentience
#TECH33
We are no longer particularly in the business of writing software
to perform specific tasks. We now teach the software how to learn,
and in the primary bonding process it molds itself around the task
to be performed. The feedback loop never really ends, so a tenth year
polysentience can be a priceless jewel or a psychotic wreck, but it
is the primary bonding—the childhood, if you will—that has the most
far-reaching repercussions.
^
^       —Bad’l Ron, Wakener,
^        Morgan Polysoft

##Self-Aware Machines
#TECH34
Without sensibility no object would be given to us, without
understanding no object would be thought. Thoughts without content
are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind.
^
^       —Immanuel Kant,
^       “Critique of Pure Reason”, Datalinks

^        Metagenics Biomachinery Division

##Doctrine: Initiative
#TECH35
A ship at sea is its own world. To be the captain of a ship is
to be the unquestioned ruler of that world and requires all of
the leadership skills of a prince or minister.
^
^       —Colonel Corazon Santiago,
^       “Leadership and the Sea”

##Doctrine: Flexibility
#TECH36
He held his arm too stiffly, and so was thrown back repeatedly,
until at last I seized his forearm and snapped it back against
itself. His training suffered while the arm healed, of course,
but I felt this was a lesson he must learn early, and well.
^
^       —Spartan Kel,
^       “Honing the Ki”

##Intellectual Integrity
#TECH37
Man’s unfailing capacity to believe what he prefers to be true
rather than what the evidence shows to be likely and possible has
always astounded me. We long for a caring Universe which will save
us from our childish mistakes, and in the face of mountains of
evidence to the contrary we will pin all our hopes on the slimmest
of doubts. God has not been proven not to exist, therefore
he must exist.
^
^       —Academician Prokhor Zakharov,
^       “For I Have Tasted The Fruit”

##Synthetic Fossil Fuels
#TECH38
Fossil fuels in the last century reached their extreme prices
because of their inherent utility: they pack a great deal of
potential energy into an extremely efficient package. If we can
but sidestep the 100 million year production process, we can corner
this market once again.
^
^       —CEO Nwabudike Morgan,
^        Strategy Session

##Doctrine: Air Power
#TECH39
Air Power rests at the apex of the first triad of victory, for it
combines Mobility, Flexibility, and Initiative.
^
^       —Spartan Battle Manual

##Photon/Wave Mechanics
#TECH40
Time dilates as the speed of light approaches. To the extent that
light consists of particles, it is in its own way timeless. Through
simple perturbations of the temporal manifold, we can refract or
repel photons most efficiently.
^
^       —Academician Prokhor Zakharov,
^       “Now We Are Alone”

##Mind/Machine Interface
#TECH41
The Warrior’s bland acronym, MMI, obscures the true horror of
this monstrosity. Its inventors promise a new era of genius, but
meanwhile unscrupulous power brokers use its forcible installation
to violate the sanctity of unwilling human minds. They are
creating their own private army of demons.
^
^       —Commissioner Pravin Lal,
^       “Report on Human Rights”

##Nanominiaturization
#TECH42
Objects once measured in meters have become so small that they cannot
be seen by the naked eye, with revolutionary applications across
the board. Gentlemen, forget what your courtesans have told you:
size does matter!
^

##Doctrine: Loyalty
#TECH43
Therefore a wise prince will seek means by which his subjects
will always and in every possible condition of things have need
of his government, and then they will always be faithful to him.
^
^       —Niccolò Machiavelli,
^       “The Prince”, Datalinks

##Ethical Calculus
#TECH44
Some vices miss what is right because they are deficient, others
because they are excessive, in feelings or in actions, while virtue
finds and chooses the mean.
^
^       —Aristotle,
^       “Nichomachean Ethics”, Datalinks

##Industrial Economics
#TECH45
Our first challenge is to create an entire economic infrastructure, from
top to bottom, out of whole cloth. No gradual evolution from previous
economic systems is possible, because there IS no previous economic
system. Each interdependent piece must be materialized simultaneously
and in perfect working order; otherwise the system will crash out
before it ever gets off the ground.
^
^       —CEO Nwabudike Morgan,
^       “The Centauri Monopoly”

##Industrial Automation
#TECH46
In the borehole pressure mines 100km beneath Planetsurface,
at the Mohorovicic Discontinuity where crust gives way to mantle,
temperatures often reach levels well in excess of 1000°C.
Exploitation of Planet’s resources under such brutal conditions has
required quantum advances in robotic and teleoperational technology.
^
^       —Morgan Industries, Ltd.,
^       “Annual Report”

##Centauri Meditation
#TECH47
The Isle of the Deep is really not a single creature but a colony
of thousands of individual tubules, an aquatic vector of the Mind Worm
which terrorizes Planet’s continents. Over its lifetime certain tubules
secrete a tough, gluelike substance which hardens to form the
characteristic shell that floats the colony and creates the appearance
of a rogue island.
^

^       “A Comparative Biology of Planet”

##Secrets of the Human Brain
#TECH48
There are only two ways in which we can account for a necessary
agreement of experience with the concepts of its objects: either
experience makes these concepts possible or these concepts make
experience possible.
^
^       —Immanuel Kant,
^       “Critique of Pure Reason”, Datalinks

##Gene Splicing
#TECH49
The genetic code does not, and cannot, specify the nature
and position of every capillary in the body or every neuron
in the brain. What it {can} do is describe the underlying
fractal pattern which creates them.
^
^       —Academician Prokhor Zakharov,
^       “Nonlinear Genetics”

##Bio-Engineering
#TECH50
Why do you insist that the human genetic code is “sacred” or “taboo”?
It is a chemical process and nothing more. For that matter [we] are
chemical processes and nothing more. If you deny yourself a useful
tool simply because it reminds you uncomfortably of your mortality,
you have uselessly and pointlessly crippled yourself.
^
^       —Chairman Sheng-ji Yang,
^       “Looking God in the Eye”

##Biomachinery
#TECH51
I loved my chosen. How then to face the day when she left me?
So I took from her body a single cell, perhaps to love her again.
^
^       —Commissioner Pravin Lal,
^       “Time of Bereavement”

##Neural Grafting
#TECH52
I think, and my thoughts cross the barrier into the synapses of the
machine, just as the good doctor intended. But what I cannot shake,
and what hints at things to come, is that thoughts cross back. In my
dreams, the sensibility of the machine invades the periphery of my
consciousness: dark, rigid, cold, alien. Evolution is at work here,
but just what is evolving remains to be seen.
^
^       —Commissioner Pravin Lal,

##Cyberethics
#TECH53
The wicked have told me of things that delight them, but not
such things as your law has to tell.
^
^       —Saint Augustine,
^       “Confessions”, Datalinks

##Eudaimonia
#TECH54
The happy life is thought to be one of excellence; now
an excellent life requires exertion, and does not consist
in amusement. If Eudaimonia, or happiness, is activity in
accordance with excellence, it is reasonable that it should
be in accordance with the highest excellence; and this will
be that of the best thing in us.
^
^       —Aristotle,
^       “Nichomachean Ethics”, Datalinks

##The Will to Power
#TECH55
Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman—a rope
over an abyss. A dangerous across, a dangerous on-the-way,
a dangerous looking-back, a dangerous shuddering and
stopping. What is great in man is that he is a bridge and
not an end: what can be loved in man is that he is an overture
and a going under. I love those who do not know how to
live, for they are those who cross over.
^

##Threshold of Transcendence
#TECH56
And when he has brought forth and reared this perfect virtue, he
shall be called the friend of god, and if ever it is given to man
to put on immortality, it shall be given to him.

##Centauri Empathy
#TECH58
Observe the Razorbeak as it tends so carefully to the fungal blooms;
just the right bit from the yellow, then a swatch from the pink.
Follow the Glow Mites as they gather and organize the fallen spores.
What higher order guides their work? Mark my words: someone or something
is {managing} the ecology of this planet.

##Ecological Engineering
#TECH60
The prevalence of anoxic environments rich in organic material,
combined with the presence of nitrated compounds has
led to an astonishing variety of underground organisms which live in
the absence of oxygen and “breathe” nitrate. Likewise, the scarcity
of carbon in the environment has forced plants to economize on its use.
Thus, all our efforts to return carbon to the biosphere will encourage
the native life to proliferate. Conversely, the huge quantities
of nitrate in the soil will be heaven to human farmers.

##Centauri Psi
#TECH63
The Mind Worms are the natural defenses of the living Planet—the
white blood cells, if you will. In a world in which unassimilated
thought represents danger, the Mind Worm seeks out concentrations of
sentient mental energy and destroys them, ruthlessly and efficiently.

##Secrets of Creation
#TECH65
And when the hourglass has run out, the hourglass of temporality,
when the noise of secular life has grown silent and its restless or
ineffectual activism has come to an end, when everything around you
is still, as it is in eternity, then eternity asks you and every
individual in these millions and millions about only one thing:
whether you have lived in despair or not.
^

^       “The Sickness Unto Death”, Datalinks

##Advanced Spaceflight
#TECH66
And so we return again to the holy void. Some say this is simply our
destiny, but I would have you remember always that the void EXISTS,
just as surely as you or I. Is nothingness any less a miracle than
substance?

^       “We Must Dissent”

##Homo Superior
#TECH67
Companions the creator seeks, not corpses, not herds and
believers. Fellow creators the creator seeks—those who write
new values on new tablets. Companions the creator seeks, and
fellow harvesters; for everything about him is ripe for the
harvest.

##Organic Superlubricant

Organic Superlube? Oh, it’s great stuff, great stuff.
You really have to keep an eye on it, though—it’ll try and slide
away from you the first chance it gets.

Men in their arrogance claim to understand the nature of creation,
and devise elaborate theories to describe its behavior. But always
they discover in the end that God was quite a bit more clever than

##Nanomatter Editation
#TECH71
‘Abort, Retry, Fail?’ was the phrase some wormdog scrawled
next to the door of the Edit Universe project room. And when
the new dataspinners started working, fabricating their worlds

##Optical Computers
#TECH72
We have reached an informational threshold which can only be crossed
by harnessing the speed of light directly. The quickest computations
require the fastest possible particles moving along the shortest

#TECH73
Already we have turned all of our critical industries, all of our
material resources, over to these … things … these lumps
of silver and paste we call nanorobots. And now we propose to teach
them intelligence? What, pray tell, will we do when these little

##Centauri Genetics
#TECH74
Remember, genes are {not} blueprints. This means you can’t, for example,
insert “the genes for an elephant’s trunk” into a giraffe and get a
giraffe with a trunk. There [are] no genes for trunks. What you {can} do
with genes is chemistry, since DNA codes for chemicals. For instance,
we can in theory splice the native plants’ talent for nitrogen fixation
into a terran plant.

##Sentient Econometrics
#TECH75
The fungus has been Planet’s dominant lifeform since about
the time of the Lower Paleozoic on Earth. But when, once every
hundred million years or so, the neural net at last achieves the
critical mass necessary to become sentient, the final metamorphosis
kills off most of the other life on the planet. It is possible that
we humans can help to break this tragic cycle.

I have often been asked: if we have traveled between the stars,

and creating the infrastructure necessary to support such an
effort. In short, we have struggled under the limitations of a
colonial society on a virgin planet. Until now.

##Progenitor Psych
#TECH78
And I stood before him, and I sang unto her, and it appeared to
listen. His very countenance rippled like the sea, and the sound
of my own voice came back to me, distorted. For a moment I thought
she was mocking me, or it was non-sapient and mimicking me. Then I
understood: the sounds were not important; it was how I affected
his sounds and how she affected mine that transmitted the message.

The Progenitor race appears to sense, and possibly even manipulate,
local fields an untrained human cannot perceive without mechanical aid,

be developed into a powerful combat awareness that can foil any attempt

War is war; destruction is destruction. You think this is obvious.

you in your quest for additional power.

##Adaptive Economics
#TECH81
Humans : correct in making the leap from wealth as currency to wealth as
energy. But logic failure : wealth ultimately is extension of desire, fluctuating
with emotions and state of mind. Desires : when all are supported in purely adaptable
system, true wealth is achieved.

I saw the alien phalanx coming toward us, and I calmed my mind as Kri’lan had taught

resonance around them. I cursed the aliens...with power like that, each one could fight
as many, and I thanked Planet for sending us the betrayer.

And here we tinker with metal, to try to give it a kind of life, and suffer those who

idea of intelligence residing within meat?

Kri’lan taught me of the resonance and how to feel it. After much training, I could
see—the very surface under our feet, Planet itself—is a living, fluctuating nexus
of energy, violent, beautiful and quite unstable. And I could also feel its
cousins—distant mirrors on the other side of the space-time continuum—the
far-flung Manifolds.

but I was severely shaken by the extent of their revulsion towards a
project so vital to our survival.

##Nanohospital
#HELPFAC18
It is a medical commonplace that the tissues of the human body
replace themselves regularly, essentially creating an entirely
new body every seven years. From whence then come cancer and the
slow degeneration of age? They exist as faults in the patterns of
intelligence within the genes themselves; by reprogramming these
smallest parts, the whole becomes well.

#HELPFAC20
Look at any photograph or work of art. If you could duplicate
exactly the first tiny dot of color, and then the next and the
next, you would end with a perfect copy of the whole,
indistinguishable from the original in every way, including
the so-called “moral value” of the art itself. Nothing can
transcend its smallest elements.

#HELPFAC21
And when at last it is time for the transition from megacorporation to
planetary government, from entrepreneur to emperor, it is then that the
true genius of our strategy shall become apparent, for energy is the
lifeblood of this society and when the chips are down he who controls
the energy supply controls Planet. In former times the energy monopoly
was called “The Power Company”; we intend to give this name an entirely
new meaning.

##Genejack Factory
#HELPFAC22
My gift to industry is the genetically engineered worker, or
Genejack. Specially designed for labor, the Genejack’s muscles and
nerves are ideal for his task, and the cerebral cortex has been
atrophied so that he can desire nothing except to perform his
duties. Tyranny, you say? How can you tyrannize someone who cannot
feel pain?

##Punishment Sphere
#HELPFAC23
It is not uncommon to see patients undergo permanent psychological
trauma in the presence of the Sphere, before the nerve stapler has
even been strapped into position. Its effect on the general
consciousness of the culture is profound: husbands have seen
wives go inside, and mothers their children. Dr. Xynan left the
surface of the sphere semitranslucent for a reason. You can hear
them in there; you can see them. It is a thing of terrible beauty.

#HELPFAC24
The chief aim of their constitution and government is that,
whenever public needs permit, all citizens should be free, so far
as possible, to withdraw their time and energy from the service of
the body, and devote themselves to the freedom and culture of the
mind. For that, they think, is the real happiness of life.

Superior training and superior weaponry have, when taken together,

The sea is everything. It covers seven-tenths of the globe. Its breath
is pure and healthy. It is an immense desert where a man is never
alone, for he can feel life quivering all about him. The sea is only
a receptacle for all the prodigious, supernatural things that exist
inside it; it is only movement and love; it is the living infinite.

You are orphans, earthdeirdre, your homeworld already buried
so young among the aeons. Yet now you fill the skies where
we watched a million sunsets with flame and contrails, paying
no heed to the hard lessons the universe has tried to teach you.
Are you a breath of life to invigorate a complacent world,
you earthhumans, or an insidious cancer which must be excised?

We are all aware that the senses can be deceived, the eyes fooled.
But how can we be sure our senses are not being deceived at any
particular time, or even all the time? Might I just be a brain in
a tank somewhere, tricked all my life into believing in the events
of this world by some insane computer? And does my life gain or lose
meaning based on my reaction to such solipsism?

In the years since our arrival, we have foolishly disrupted so
many of Planet’s ecosystems that entire species may vanish
without our ever having understood, or even known them. We must halt
this plunder, and halt it immediately, for our own survival as a
species depends on our ability to strike a balance on this world.

Sky farms are fantastically beautiful, with their kilometer long
networks of glass framed in grids of metal, and the sunlight
shining through jungles of vegetation inside. When one of them
catches the light, you can see the refracted beauty for miles;
they are life-giving stars on a desolate planet … gardens on
the wing.

Planet’s Primary, Alpha Centauri A, blasts unimaginable quantities

I hold a scrap of paper in the darkness and
