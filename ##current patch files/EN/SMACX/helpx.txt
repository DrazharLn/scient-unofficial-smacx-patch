#;Politics
#HELPSOC0
The {Politics} social category determines the basic political system:

^    $LINK<Police State=120002>
^    $LINK<Democratic=120003>
^    $LINK<Fundamentalist=120004>

#;Frontier
#HELPSOC00
{Frontier} politics represent the informal governing arrangements made in
early colonies, before populations reach levels requiring more advanced
forms of government.
^
^Prerequisite: {None}

#;Police State
#HELPSOC01
{Police States} use oppression to keep their citizens in line, and allow
their leaders great power over military decisions. But oppression of
this type also decreases economic efficiency.
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Democratic
#HELPSOC02
{Democracies} allow citizens to participate in government, and forgo
oppression and the stability it confers in favor of growth and
efficiency. But citizens remain suspicious of large military
deployments, and civilian oversight creates large military
bureaucracies, so military support costs increase.
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Fundamentalist
#HELPSOC03
{Fundamentalist} politics unite a society behind a strong, dogmatic
religion. Evangelizing the populace can create loyal, even fanatical
military forces, and tends to immunize citizens against (other forms of)
brainwashing, but technological research tends to suffer under the
continual assaults on intellectual integrity associated with such
regimes.
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Economics
#HELPSOC1
The {Economics} social category controls the way an economy is managed:
^    $LINK<Simple=120006>
^    $LINK<Free Market=120007>
^    $LINK<Planned=120008>
^    $LINK<Green=120009>

#;Simple
#HELPSOC10
{Simple} Economics describes the informal, ad hoc economy which develops
in the early years of planetfall, before more organized economic systems
can be put in place.
^
^Prerequisite: {None}

#;Free Market
#HELPSOC11
{Free Market} economics turns market forces loose in your society.
Unfettered market economics can produce great wealth quickly, but in the
context of Planet’s fragile emerging economies can also lead to extremes
of pollution and ecological damage. Also, citizens rendered suddenly
poor by the actions unscrupulous moguls may revolt against their energy-
fattened masters.
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Planned
#HELPSOC12
A semi-market economy kept in check by fierce governmental regulation,
{Planned} economics promotes stable industrial and population growth, but
sacrifices efficiency.
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Green
#HELPSOC13
{Green} economics strives to integrate sentient progress with the needs
of the biosphere. Green economies use resources efficiently and tend to
avoid the excesses of industrial development which could provoke
Planet’s $LINK<native life=10022>, but population growth necessarily suffers for lack
of space.
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;VALUES
#HELPSOC2
The {Values} social category sets major priorities for a society:
^    $LINK<Survival=120011>
^    $LINK<Power=120012>
^    $LINK<Knowledge=120013>
^    $LINK<Wealth=120014>

#;Survival
#HELPSOC20
{Survival} is of course the all-encompassing first priority of early human
or $LINK<Progenitor=36> colonies.
^
^Prerequisite: {None}

#;Power
#HELPSOC21
Leaders seeking {Power} build strong, well-paid military forces to enforce
their will. But Economic and industrial infrastructure may suffer from
bloated [defense] budgets (these negative effects are eliminated by
control of $LINK<The Cloning Vats=110024>).
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Knowledge
#HELPSOC22
Leaders seeking {Knowledge} and intellectual enlightenment will pour
resources into research and education. They will also tend to promote
the free exchange of information, which increases efficiency but also
carries greater security risks.
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Wealth
#HELPSOC23
Leaders seeking {Wealth} will concentrate on building economic and
industrial infrastructure rapidly. They achieve rapid growth and
development, with possible side effects being decadence and moral decay.
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Future Society
#HELPSOC3
Future Societies show speculatively how society may evolve in the far
future:
^    $LINK<None=120016>
^    $LINK<Cybernetic=120017>
^    $LINK<Eudaimonic=120018>
^    $LINK<Thought Control=120019>

#;None
#HELPSOC30
{None}, or no Future Society, simply means that a society has not yet
evolved to a far future society.
^
^Prerequisite: {None}

#;Cybernetic
#HELPSOC31
In the far future, citizens may turn many of the tasks of governing
society over to artificially intelligent computers, increasing
efficiency and freeing individuals for more creative tasks. But will
workers displaced by computers sink into despair, poverty, and possible
unrest? (These negative effects are eliminated by control of
$LINK<The Network Backbone=110021>.)
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Eudiamonic
#HELPSOC32
Perhaps the most pleasant to contemplate living in, this far future society
takes its name from an ancient Greek word for fulfillment and
happiness. {Eudaimonic} society encourages each citizen to achieve
happiness through striving to fulfill completely his or her potential.
Population, Economy, and Industry all experience healthy growth.
Violence fades as society grows more tolerant and just, and even when
this society’s hand is forced it often shoots to subdue rather than to
destroy.
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Thought Control
#HELPSOC33
The ultimate in “Big Brother” methods, {Thought Control} effuses subtle
neurochemical triggers into the atmosphere to render its population
obedient, loyal, and resistant to outside ideas. But significant
resources are required to maintain this level of control (these negative
effects are eliminated by control of $LINK<The Cloning Vats=110024>).
^
^Prerequisite: $LINK<$STR0=$NUM0>

#;Economy

^    +4 = +3 Morale!!

#;Police
#HELPEFFECT5
{Police} represents a society’s tolerance for police control and
restrictions on personal freedom. A high score allows combat units to be
used as police to pacify unhappy $LINK<Drone=11>. A low score will cause
increasing unhappiness when combat units are away from home (non-$LINK<Air Superiority=80005>
air combat units have the same effect as units away
from home):
^    -5 = Two extra drones for each military unit away from territory
^    -4 = Extra drone for each military unit away from territory

^    +1 = Can use up to two military units as police
^    +2 = Can use up to three military units as police!
^    +3 = Three units as police. [Police effect doubled!!]

#;Growth
#HELPEFFECT6
{Growth} affects population growth rate. The higher the score, the fewer
$LINK<Nutrients=31> bases need in order to grow:

unit is equipped with the $LINK<Algorithmic Enhancement=80028> special ability

#;Industry
#HELPEFFECT9
{Industry} represents manufacturing strength. A high score reduces the
number of $LINK<Minerals=27> required to build units and facilities:
^    -3 = Mineral costs increased by 30%

#;Solar Collector
#HELPTERRALAND3
A {solar collector} produces $LINK<Energy=14>. The amount of energy produced depends
on the $LINK<altitude=10000> of the square and can be increased by the adjacent
construction of an $LINK<Echelon Mirror=90013>.
^
^Solar collectors require eight turns to construct in rocky squares.

appear on the map as $LINK<unity pods=49> until a players unit moves onto the same square.
^
^Once discovered, Alien Artifacts have one movement point and behave as non-combatant units. If they are used to explore a
unity pod they have a 50% chance of vanishing. They can be captured by other factions without $LINK<diplomatic penalty=8>
if they are not in a stack with other non-alien artifact units. They are attacked and destroyed by $LINK<wild native
lifeforms=10022>, $LINK<needlejets=40005>, and $LINK<copters=40006>.
^
^Artifacts can be moved to bases that have a $LINK<network node=100008> facility or $LINK<The Universal Translator=110020>
secret project and linked to it to provide a random technological breakthrough. Each network node can only link to one
alien artifact¹. They can also be use it to speed the production of a Secret Project or unit $LINK<prototype=37> by 50
minerals. On rare occasions, linking an Alien Artefact to a Network Node results in an overload destroying both unit and
facility. Linked Network Nodes cannot be scrapped for money, only destroyed.
^
^Using the goto (‘G’) command on an Alien Artifact will indicate which bases (including those of pact partners) have
Network Nodes and whether they are already linked to an Artifact.
^
^If an Alien Artifact is in a base, holding or on sentry mode, it will activate if a secret project or prototype is
commenced or if a network node or The Universal Translator is completed prompting a player that they can use the artifact.

#;Mind Worms
#UNITDESC8
The dominant $LINK<native life form=30> of Planet is the {mind worm}, a horrid-looking little parasitic carnivore about 10
cm long. A single mind worm is a dangerous pest, able to burrow into a human brain and devour it, while the victim succumbs
to violent delusions or dangerous fantasies, or lives out his deepest terrors.
^
^Far worse than a single worm, mind worms are known to form vast mobile colonies, called “boils”, which can overwhelm a
military unit or a whole human base.
^
^With proper breeding and bonding techniques, Mind Worms can also be bred in captivity and controlled by skilled brood
trainers.

#;Isle of the Deep
#UNITDESC9
An aquatic vector of the $LINK<Mind Worms=30008> $LINK<native life form=30>, the {Isle of the Deep} is closely associated
with $LINK<Sea Fungus=18>. Spending their early life underwater, in maturity they surface as a floating shell formed by the
secretions of the colony’s individual members. They are often used as a nesting place by Mind Worms and $LINK<Spore
Launchers=30015> and can even float large land units much like a $LINK<troop transport=60019>. The transport capacity is
determined by the life cycle level: one unit for each level.
^
^With proper breeding and bonding techniques, Isles of the Deep can be bred in captivity and controlled by skilled brood
trainers.

#;Locusts of Chiron
#UNITDESC10
Locusts of Chiron are rare $LINK<Native life forms=30>, and “wild” locusts are rarely seen outside of periods of unusual
mind worm activity. Periodically, a pre-boil mass of $LINK<mind worms=30008> in a $LINK<xenofungal=18> bloom spontaneously,
and for unknown reason, metamorphoses so that they all grow wings, whereupon the worms take off as a boil-swarm.
^
^Though they cannot be captured in the wild, with proper breeding and bonding techniques, they can be bred in captivity and
controlled by skilled brood trainers.

travel underwater and can attack bases and units on the coast.
^
^With proper breeding and bonding techniques, Sealurks can also be bred in captivity and controlled by skilled brood
trainers.

#;Spore Launcher
#UNITDESC15
{Spore Launchers} are $LINK<native life forms=30> that can appear singly or in the company of $LINK<Mind Worms=30008>, and
are closely associated with $LINK<Fungus=18>. Spore Launchers tend to lurk on the outskirts of a settlement, expelling
bursts of corrosive spores that can destroy man-made or Progenitor improvements from a range of two squares away. These
spores are also effective against units.
^
^Spore Launchers are aggressive and highly territorial and will attack other nearby spore launchers. When defending
territory, tame Spore Launchers may also engage in artillery duels with units of their own faction.
^
^With proper breeding and bonding techniques, Spore Launchers can also be bred in captivity and controlled by skilled brood
trainers.

#;Fungal Tower
#UNITDESC19
{Fungal Towers} are $LINK<native life forms=30> that act as a localized nervous system for $LINK<Fungus=18> patches. These
Towers are massive, jumbled tangles of Mind Worms, fungus, and other strange native life forms. Although the Towers cannot
move or attack, they block movement through their terrain and exert a $LINK<Zone of control=53> that can impede units in
the area.
^
^When attacked, Fungal Towers receive a 50% bonus due to their ability to co-ordinate and direct native life forms in the
area. The size and power of Fungal Towers depends on the amount of fungus adjacent to the Tower. Towers can also generate
fungus in nearby empty squares.

#;Unity Mining Laser

#;Terraforming Unit
#WEAPONDESC18
Units with the {Terraforming Unit} module can be used to improve and shape the terrain of Planet.
^
^This module can be added to the $LINK<infantry=40000>, $LINK<speeder=40001>, $LINK<hovertank=40002>, $LINK<foil=40003>,
$LINK<cruiser=40004>, and $LINK<gravship=40007> chassis.
^
^    Crew: 367
^    Composition: Bonded steel/ceramic
^    Armament: Sidearms only

#;Troop Transport
#WEAPONDESC19
The {Troop Transport} module allows a unit to transport other units. It reduces the movement of land and sea units by one
and air units by 50%+1.
^
^Only sea-going units can transport more than one unit at a time. A $LINK<foil=40003> can transport a number of units equal
to twice its reactor value. A $LINK<cruiser=40004> can transport a number of units equal to four times its reactor value.
^
^Transports can normally transport only ground units, but sea-going transports can be given the $LINK<Carrier Deck=80007>
special ability to allow them to transport and refuel air units.
^
^Air transports can only load passengers in a base or airbase. Choosing the ‘Unload Transport’ (‘Shift+U’) command from the
action menu will allow the passengers to unload while the air transport is in flight.
^
^    Capacity: 500 troops + support
^    Composition: Hardened plasteel
^    Hydroponics rating: ST

#;Supply Transport
#WEAPONDESC20
The {Supply Transport} module can be used to create $LINK<units=30005> that harvest or transport $LINK<nutrients=31>, or
$LINK<minerals=27>, or $LINK<energy=14>. Any unit with the Supply Transport module has no $LINK<support=130002> cost.
^
^Selecting the ‘Convoy’ (‘O’) option on the ‘Action Menu’ brings up a menu from which can be selected the resources to
convoy:
^    • if a supply transport is placed in a friendly base then it delivers available resources from its home base to the
one where it is currently located
^    • if a supply transport is outside a base, it delivers available resources from the square it occupies to its home
base each turn
^
^The unit cannot deliver resources from a square already being worked by a base’s citizens.
^
^Convoy resources receive the benefits of facilities and secret projects in their home base that increase the resources
collected.
^
^Supply transports disbanded in friendly bases yield their {full} mineral value towards  the construction of a secret
project or $LINK<prototypes=37>.
^
^This module can be added to all chassis except $LINK<missile=40008>.
^
^    Capacity: 2575 mt
^    Composition: reinforced plasteel
^    Armament: Sidearms only

#;Probe Module
#WEAPONDESC21
The {Probe Module} can be used to create $LINK<units=30006> able to engage in espionage. Any unit with the Probe module has
no supply cost.
^
^Probes can infiltrate and subvert enemy bases and units. They can steal enemy research information, energy credits,
sabotage base facilities, assassinate key enemy personnel to slow research, free captured faction leaders from
headquarters, and conduct genetic warfare (with the discovery of $LINK<Retroviral Engineering=140075>). Move a probe up to
an enemy base or single unit to engage its powers.
^
^Probes can ignore any $LINK<Zone of control=53>. Probe can also defend your bases against their enemy counterparts. If a
probe is present in a square when an enemy probe tries to enter, a combat is resolved between them. The probe with the
highest $LINK<Morale=130004> level usually wins. Probes often receive morale increases when they complete missions
successfully. The higher a probe’s morale level, the more likely it is to survive more risky missions.
^
^Both $LINK<Comm Jammer=80009> and $LINK<Hypnotic Trance=80018> can be added to units with Probe Module for no cost.
^
^This module can be added to the $LINK<infantry=40000>, $LINK<speeder=40001>, $LINK<hovertank=40002>, $LINK<foil=40003>,
and $LINK<cruiser=40004> chassis.

#;Conventional Payload
#WEAPONDESC23
The {Conventional Payload} weapons package can be used to create conventional missiles. It can be used only with the
$LINK<Missile=40008> chassis. Conventional missiles attack at the following strengths:
^    $LINK<Fission Plant=50001> = 9
^    $LINK<Fusion Reactor=50002> = 18
^    $LINK<Quantum Chamber=50003> = 27
^    $LINK<Singularity Engine=50004> = 36

#;Tectonic Payload
#WEAPONDESC24
The {Tectonic Payload} weapons package can be used to create Tectonic Missiles. It can be used only with the
$LINK<Missile=40008> chassis.
^
^A Tectonic Missile detonation causes an earthquake that raises the target terrain by one to four levels of
$LINK<altitude=0>, depending on the reactor type. A $LINK<Fission Plant=50001> raises the terrain one level, a
$LINK<Singularity Engine=50004> up to four levels. Tectonic missiles are considered delivery platforms instead of combat
units, and so may not target bases or units.
^
^To target a square, move the missile to the desired target (cannot be a sea square) and press the ‘I’ key.

#;Fungal Payload
#WEAPONDESC25
The {Fungal Payload} weapons package can be used to create Fungal Missiles. It can be used only with the
$LINK<Missile=40008> chassis.
^
^A Fungal Missile detonation destroys any improvements in the square. Additionally, the detonation covers one to four
squares of terrain with $LINK<fungus=18>, depending on the reactor type. A $LINK<Fission Plant=50001> covers one square, a
$LINK<Singularity Engine=50004> four squares. The detonation may also trigger $LINK<native life forms=30> from dormant
spores. Fungal Missiles are considered delivery platforms instead of combat units, and so may not target bases or units.
^
^To target a square, move the missile to the desired target (cannot be a sea-square) and press the ‘I’ key.

#;Super Former
#ABILDESC0
{SmartSettler V2.0 software upgrade}
^
^Can be used only with $LINK<terraforming units=60018>.

#;Deep Radar
#ABILDESC1
{Mk. 45 Sensor array upgrade}

#;Cloaking Device
#ABILDESC2
{Type IV Refraction/diffusion shield}
^
^A {Cloaking Device} allows a unit to avoid detection by enemy units unless they actually attempt to enter the same square.

#;Amphibious Pods
#ABILDESC3
{Hoverpod LCs}
^
^Units with {Amphibious Pods} may also move and attack across the channels between sea bases and continents.

#;Drop Pods
#ABILDESC4
{Aircushion LCs}
^
^A unit must begin its turn in a friendly base or $LINK<airbase==90008> in order to make an airdrop.
^
^Airdrops may be made within eight squares. With the discovery of $LINK<Graviton Theory=140022> or the construction of
$LINK<The Space Elevator=110027>, units with Drop Pods can make orbital insertions anywhere on Planet.
^
^Non-combat units lose all movement after an air drop or orbital insertion. Combat units may move after an airdrop, but if
they attack, a 50% combat penalty applies. Airdropped units may take up to 30% $LINK<damage=7> (except when dropped into a
friendly base), but will always survive the airdrop.

#;Air Superiority
#ABILDESC5
{Mk. 66 fire control sensor}
^
^Air units with {Air Superiority} gain a +100% combat advantage when attacking other air units in flight, but incur a -50%
penalty if they attack ground or naval units.
^
^Ground or Naval units with air superiority do not gain the 100% bonus vs air, but they do not get the 50% penalty vs other
ground or naval units either.
^
^Air-to-air combat is resolved by comparing attack factors—the armor value is ignored. A ground unit equipped with Air
Superiority can attack an adjacent Needlejet chassis at sea. A Naval unit equipped with Air Superiority can attack an
adjacent Needlejet chassis on land.
^
^A $LINK<Needlejet=40005> unit with air superiority is able to {scramble} against an air attack or hostile $LINK<air
drop=80004> within a two square radius. The interceptor needs to be stationed at a base or airbase. Use the skip turn
(‘Space bar’}) or hold command (‘H’) to allow the interceptor to scramble.

#;Deep Pressure Hull
#ABILDESC6
{Reinforced Silksteel chassis}
^
^A {Deep Pressure Hull} allows a sea unit to move underwater making it difficult for enemies to detect, unless the attempt
to enter the same square.

#;Carrier Deck
#ABILDESC7
{Bonded alloy flight deck}
^
^A {Carrier Deck} allows a sea-going transport to carry and refuel air units.

#;AAA Tracking
#ABILDESC8
{Mk. 190 FUBR fire control system}

#;Comm Jammer
#ABILDESC9
{Type IX ECTS EMP pulse generator}
^
^The {Comm Jammer} ability interferes with enemy tactical command and control, thus throwing enemy mobile offensives into
confusion.
^
^Free to add to units with $LINK<Probe Module=60021>. When attacking, it also prevents the defender from
$LINK<disengaging=10>.

#;Antigrav Struts

#;Nerve Gas Pods
#ABILDESC20
{Mk. 1 VX delivery system}
^
^Can only be used against non-$LINK<Native life forms=30>. When used against units inside a base, if combat is successful,
50% of the bases’ population will be killed. If the population of the base is one, it will be destroyed.

#;Repair Bay
#ABILDESC21
{Modified Supply Transport module}
^
^Can only be used with $LINK<troop transports=60019>.

#ABILDESC22
{Stunjack cannon & training for police}

#;Soporific Gas Pods
#ABILDESC24
Employs a combination of standard sleep-inducing gas and a soothing wave-form/broad band resonance.
^
^Ineffective against $LINK<Native life forms=30>.

#;Dissociative Wave
#ABILDESC25
Enemy units get no combat bonuses from their own special abilities when
attacking a unit equipped with this high-energy field that temporarily disrupts delicate electronic equipment. The unit
equipped with dissociative waves can tune its own special equipment to “ignore” this field. The field generator is bulky
and hard to manipulate during mobile engagements, rendering it ineffective as an attack weapon.

#;Marine Detachment
#ABILDESC26
Ship equipped with this ability can capture an enemy ship 50% of the time, if the defender is reduced to 30% or less combat
strength without being destroyed in the process. Marine squads are trained in the art of ship capture, which involves fast
moving and a knowledge of where to strike the enemy vessel to cripple its command structure and avoid self-destruct
mechanisms.
^
^Any units being $LINK<transported=60019> on a ship are also captured.

#;Fuel Nanocells
#ABILDESC27

#;Algorithmic Enhancement
#ABILDESC28
Enhanced Probes can also infiltrate bases and units regardless of social engineering choices or $LINK<The Hunter-Seeker
Algorithm=110015> Secret Project, although they still have a high probability of failure.
