“Now it’s day and night the irons clang, and like poor galley slaves
^We toil and toil, and when we die, must fill dishonored graves
^But some dark night, when everything is silent in the town
^I’ll shoot those tyrants one and all, I’ll gun the flogger down
^I’ll give the land a little shock, remember what I say,
^And they’ll yet regret they’ve sent Jim Jones in chains to Botany Bay.”
 ^
