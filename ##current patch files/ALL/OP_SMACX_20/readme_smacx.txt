ALIEN CROSSFIRE VERSION 1.0

Undocumented Additions:

*Sea Borders: coastal bases now extend borders into the sea for all squares
adjacent to the base. Nearby water bases do not affect these borders.
*Detonating a fungal missile may now trigger native life forms from dormant
spores. The higher the reactor level, the greater the number of spores.
*Fungal Towers receive a 50% bonus when attacked, due to their ability to
co-ordinate and direct native life forms in the vicinity.
*A Progenitor faction controlling the Manifold Nexus receives +1 Research in
addition to +1 Planet.
*The Manifold Usurpers have a -1 Planet due to their intent to subvert the
Transcendence process.
*The Cybernetic Consciousness may steal technology when capturing a base,
regardless of the rules preference set at the beginning.
*The Data Angels now get any technology discovered by three other factions
with whom they have an infiltrator.
*Any units adjacent to a mind controlled base fall under the control of the
probe teams faction.
*The Dissociative Wave now works on offense.
*The manual states that an alien may be in a submission pact and not affect
a diplomatic victory; this is not true. For a human faction to win a
diplomatic victory, both alien factions must be completely eliminated from
the game, regardless of their Pact status.

CHANGES IN ALPHA CENTAURI VERSION 2.0

-----------------------------------------------

The v2.0 Update to Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri includes several new features
to enhance the Alpha Centauri gameplay experience as well as a host of small
fixes. Most notably, v2.0 includes Hotseat and Play-by-email multiplayer
modes.  A complete list of v2.0 changes is included below.

ADDITIONS
*       HOTSEAT multiplayer mode is now available!
*       Play-by-email multiplayer mode is now available!
*       To start a hotseat game, select Multiplayer from the main menu and
then Hotseat/PBEM. After setting up Planet, select a faction for each of the
human players. Each player has an opportunity to select a password on their
first turn to provide a level of privacy. Leave the field blank to bypass
this feature. When a player ends their turn, a prompt will appear for the
next player. If playing Hotseat, the next player should take over here. If
playing PBEM, select Save and Exit. The game automatically exits, at which
point you should email the resulting save game to the next player (as
indicated on the last on-screen prompt). Most features of the game are
identical to non-simultaneous multiplayer games. A notable difference
however is Diplomacy, which can now takes place over several turns. After
contacting another player, make your selections and hit End Transmission.
When the other player's turn begins, the diplomacy window will appear with
your proposal. Negotiations can take place over any number of turns.
*       You can now see the destination of a unit without selecting it. This
option can be toggled under "Map" preferences.
*       You can now disable probe team "steal technology in the RULES
section of ALPHA.TXT.
*       You can now release mind worms into wild using the "Turn Over Unit
Control" option on the Action Menu.
*       You can now customize the map size when generating a random planet.
*       Probe teams are now "unflagged", meaning you cannot easily tell who
controls the team.
*       Atrocities have been rebalanced to avoid abuse: (a) 12+ atrocities
(depends on difficulty level) will cause all factions to declare vendetta
(b) Nerve stapling becomes increasingly ineffective at particular bases the
more you use it.
*       The Hive now has the "Immunity, EFFIC" ability; Hive never receives
negative EFFICIENCY penalties.
*       Password security for multiplayer games.
*       Hardware 3D positional and EAX support added - Note: this can be
disabled in alpha centauri.ini by entering  ds3d=0 or eax=0. This also
provides overall better performance and memory usage.

ENHANCEMENTS
*       You can now set waypoints for patrols using the spacebar. Press "p"
key as usual to start patrol, then click-and-drag mouse to first waypoint;
while still holding mouse button, press SPACE to set waypoint; you can then
drag line to next point, etc. When you reach final destination, release
mouse button.
*       Datalinks now show cost/preq of Abilities and Terraforming
*       Combat report text is now larger in 1024x768 resolution
*       "People" icons are now smaller for cursor in base screen "drag and
drop"
*       Design Workshop: dark blue letters on dark background are now more
legible
*       You can no longer name/rename landmarks near other people's
territory.
*       Pact Brothers no longer offer map in tech trade (already gives map
for free)
*       The world map now updates as new areas are explored, as opposed to
waiting until the end of a turn.
*       Up to a 40% speed increase in TCP/IP performance.
*       Improved Caviar unit display performance.
*       Autoexploring AI with natives improved.
*       You can now automatically build roads to any square.
*       voice over data link now louder on receiving end.

FIXES
*       Map now correctly displays solar/mine/etc details at "standard zoom
out" level.
*       Air Units are no longer influenced by travel rate of fungus and so
forth.
*       Dragging air unit move: distance is now shown correctly
*       F4 screen "turns to go" now accounts for prototype cost
*       Clicking "end of turn" when a unit is active (but has already moved)
no longer says, "all units have moved".
*       New unit changes are now correctly displayed when you go to Change
Unit, then from there to unit design (where you Obsolete/Design/whatever)
and then come back the change menu again.
*       When "continue with current/change to new/add to beginning of queue"
warning is displayed after changing build command and if you pick "add to
queue" it now adds the selected unit correctly (instead of always adding a
Colony Pod).
*       Typo corrected when you hit the "Reset" button in Social Engineering
*       Squelch mode now prevents commlink requests as well as chats.
*       The host being killed in MP no longer prevents the remaining players
from continuing.
*       Economic victory now functions correctly in MP.
*       Submitted AI factions no longer send probe teams against their
captor.
*       Entering Social Engineering on first turn no longer strands the
player.

*       AI doesn't offer a human controlled faction's comm frequency to
other human players in MP.
*       "15 secs to end of turn" doesn't print numerous times in MP.
*       The energy readout in the info window isn't double it's actual value
in some instances.
*       On Citizen and Specialist Level you now get free minerals when
starting a new base.
*       Time bonuses now charged to the correct player.
*       Hitting the END key in the Production Picker now adjusts the scroll
bar.
*        Save MP games now preserves the Simultaneous Moves option.
*       The datalinks now displays the proper amount of nutrients produced
by kelp farms.
*       Formers in Multiplayer can no longer be used to produce terrain
enhancements in one turn.
*       Upgrading a unit under certain circumstances no longer creates free
prototypes.
*       Attacking a mindworm on a Unity pod now explores that pod.
*       F4 screen's "turns to go" now accounts for prototype cost.
*       Drop-pod messages no longer broadcast to all players in MP.

SINGLE PLAYER

IMPROVING PERFORMANCE

If you are experiencing performance problems, try some of the following
tips:

*  Included in the Alternative Art folder on the CD-ROM is a Low Res Caviar
folder. Copy the contents of this folder to the directory you installed the
game to. The default is c:\program files\firaxis games\sid meier's alpha
centauri. These files reduce the detail in the units, but can improve
performance.
*  Reduce your resolution to 800 x 600, rather than 1024 x 768. This can
greatly improve all game performance.
*  Disable the sound using the Audio/Visual Preferences menu.
*  Disable map animations, sliding windows, and sliding scrollbars.
*  Enable the following preferences: Move Friendly Pieces Quickly, Fast
Battle Resolution, Move Units with orders quickly, Don't Center On Units
With Orders
*  Increase the amount of free hard drive space on the C: drive.
*  Increase the amount of RAM in your system.

NEW FEATURES

* Right click on a Pact Brother from commlink menu to end a pact.

LAPTOP INSTALL

This install size copies the very minimum files to the hard that are
required by the game to operate. It also alters the default game preferences
to improve over performance.

COMPLETE INSTALL

This install copies the entire contents of the CD-Rom to the hard drive. It
requires 360 megabytes of hard drive space.

GAMMA CORRECTION / "IF THE GRAPHICS SEEM TOO DARK"

We've added a Gamma Correction feature to allow the customer to adjust the
brightness of the palette without adjusting their monitor. It is accessible
from any of the preference menus. The default value is 1.0.

WINDOWS NT

Almost all features of SMAC should work under Windows NT 4.0. You'll need to
obtain NT Service Pack 3 or higher from Microsoft and install it, which
includes DirectX 3 or higher support. Note: Sound support under NT currently
requires us to use emulated drivers; this can in some cases produce poor
sound results, including static and sound breaking up.

CPU OVERCLOCKING

If you experience random crashes and you are overclocking your CPU
(especially with AMD K-5 and K-6 processors), try returning your CPU speed
to it's original setting.

MOVIE PERFORMANCE

If your computer has problems playing some of the in-game movies, verify
that you are not using any 16-bit real mode drivers for the CD-ROM drive.
You can check this by opening the Control Panel and choosing the System
settings. Under the Performance tab, there is a line for File System. This
should read 32-bit. If it has anything else in that line, contact the
manufacturer of your CD-ROM drive for updated Windows 95/98 drivers. If you
still experience problems playing movies, try adding 'DirectDraw=0' to the
Alpha Centauri.ini file in the install directory.

ADDITIONAL TWEAKS

Once the game is installed, a file is created called "Alpha Centauri.ini".
This file contains various settings and preferences for the game, but can
also be edited by the user. The following commands will allow you some
control over the look of various parts of the game.

WindowsFileBox=1
Settings this to 1 allows you to use the traditional Win95/98 file
navigation dialog.

MainFontSize=16
You can increase or decrease the size of the font used throughout the game.

DirectDraw=0
Settings this to 0 disables DirectDraw. This disables the automatic window
resolution resizing during program launch.

Video Mode=800 or Video Mode=1024
This forces the screen resolution to either of these two sizes.

8BitMovieSound=1
This forces the sound quality to 8-bit from the original 16-bit. If your
sound card has DirectX compatibility issues, this may improve movie
performance.

ForceOldVoxelAlgorithm=1
If the game crashes intermittently, try adding this line.

TROUBLESHOOTING - If your computer has problems playing the game (crashes,
returning to desktop, etc.), please try the following:

1. Reinstall DirectX 6.1. This can be found on the CD in the \DIRECTX
folder.

2. Rename the SOUND.DLL to SOUND.DL_. While disabling the sound, it may
correct your original problem.

3. If you receive the message "CPU Not Supported", and you have a non-Intel
processor such as an AMD K-5, try to run the game anyway. Many AMD
processors show up as a 486 in verification tests, but if your machine is
'Pentium Compatible', it shouldn't be a problem.

4. Increase amount of free hard drive space on the C: drive, especially if
you have 16 or 32 megs of memory. Defragmenting this drive will also often
increase the amount of space available for Windows to use as Virtual Memory.
Also keep in mind that larger maps require more memory. Try a smaller map.

5. Let Windows handle your swap file size. This can be adjusted by running
the System Control Panel, selecting the Performance menu tab, then the
Virtual Memory button, and selecting "Let Windows manage my virtual memory
settings".

6. Update the Windows 95/98 drivers for your Video card, Sound card, and
Monitor.

7. When running the game you return directly to the desktop, you may not
have your monitor setup correctly. Try to manually set your desktop to one
of the resolutions the game supports (1024x768x8bit (256 colors) or
800x600x8bit). If you cannot manually set the resolution, you will need to
contact your computer's manufacturer for details on how to do so.

8. If you are using an TNT2 based video card (Hercules TNT2, Diamond Viper
v770, etc.) try setting your hardware acceleration to 0 in the system
control panel.

9. If the game's volume has changed since installing Alien Crossfire, try
setting those values in the audio/visual preferences.

10. Some Plextor CD-Rom drives have been reported to cause movies to stutter
when played off the CD. Contact Plextor for a BIOS upgrade which solves this
problem.

11. If you're experiencing crashes in the sound.dll, perhaps your sound card
is having difficulty supporting the Alien Crossfire's 3D Audio. Try setting
the EAX and DS3D entries in the 'alpha centauri.ini' file to 0.

12. Any 'Unable to allocate draw-buffer' errors most likely relate to
DirectX not being installed. Try reinstalling DirectX 6.1 from the \DIRECTX
folder on the Alien Crossfire CD.

MULTIPLAYER

NOTE: Encrypted MP saved game files from Alpha Centauri won't work with
Alien Crossfire.

New Features:

* Change symbol next to faction name in 'commlink' menu to 'null' (zero with
a slash through it) by clicking on it to ignore all messages from a player.

NON-SIMULTANEOUS MULTIPLAYER:

A feature we added is non-simultaneous movement in multiplayer games.
Benefits of this mode include significantly less packet transmission (to
improve performance), the ability to execute diplomacy without your turn
clock running out, and the luxury to fine tune your bases while other
players complete their moves.  Disable the Simultaneous Move option on the
Multiplayer Setup screen to use this feature.  The game plays essentially
the same as the simultaneous move game, except when other players are making
their moves, you maintain control. Except for actually moving units, you can
access any base, any report screen, initiate or participate in diplomacy,
and many other actions.

RESTARTING MULTIPLAYER SAVES:

Alpha Centauri and Alien Crossfire both support the saving of multiplayer
games in order to play later. Have the host of the game save as in a solo
game. In order to restart, have that player host the game. On the main
Multiplayer Setup screen, under Type of Game, select load. Load that save,
have the other players select their factions and begin play.

VOICE OVER DATA TROUBLESHOOTING:

One of the features of Alpha Centauri is the ability to use a microphone
connected to your sound card for real-time voice communication during
multiplay games. Below are some troubleshooting techniques you may try if
you're experiencing difficulty using this feature.

VOICE LINK TIPS:

1. Before attempting to use the voice link feature in Alpha Centauri we
recommend testing the recording functionality of your sound card with the
Sound Recorder the comes with Win '98 / '95.  If you can get that working
then the voice link will most likely work.

2. Keep in mind this feature is designed to work using as little bandwidth
as possible so quality will be marginal. However you should be able to
understand the person who is talking. If not, try experimenting with
microphone volume , mic placement, and speech volume. It may not be pretty
but it sure beats typing messages.

3. If you're unfamiliar with the Windows record settings here is how to
access them: First open up the "advanced mixer" by double clicking on the
volume control icon located on the Windows task bar (looks like a speaker).
If this icon is not present you need to enable it by opening the control
panel, multimedia properties and checking the "show volume control on
taskbar" checkbox. By having the volume control on the taskbar you can
adjust the settings while you're in the game.
Once the "advanced volume control" is showing - it looks like a mixer with a
number of sliders - look for a microphone slider. If you don't see it pull
down the options menu, look for a microphone check box and check it and hit
ok. This will add a microphone slider to your playback volume control. Make
sure that slider is muted, this will prevent feedback. Now pull down the
options menu and select recording and hit OK. From there you can adjust your
volume. Once again if you don't see the microphone slider for the record
volume control pull down the options and check the microphone check box.

4. Many sound cards come with a mic boost feature. While in the record mixer
pull down the menu and select "Advanced." Look at the mic slider.  If
there's an "Advanced" button, hit it and look for a mic boost check box.
Experiment with it to get the best sound.

5. Use the voice link like a walkie-talkie. Press down and hold the '\' key,
talk and when finished let it up.  Only talk in turns because the system is
half-duplex (It can't transmit and receive at the same time).  Avoid using
it during the upkeep phase in multiplayer since during that time it's
possible to let up on the key and not stop the recording. You know it's
working when the games sounds stop. If the games sounds don't return after
letting up (during upkeep) then wait till upkeep is finished and press and
let up on the key again - the sound should return.

KNOWN PROBLEMS:

1. During the upkeep phase in multiplayer recording may get stuck causing
game sounds to stop. just press the '\' key till the sound returns.

2. General poor sound quality of voice over data.

3. We decided to leave game sounds on during voice link reception and
incoming messages can sometimes get garbled with voice stuff in the game.

TROUBLESHOOTING:

1. Some users may experience problems when playing Alpha Centauri using
America Online (AOL) as their connection to the internet. Please consult the
web page (www.firaxis.com) for updated information concerning this issue.

2. Modem TCP/IP games with more than 2 players may degrade game performance
on some networks.  We will keep updated information on TCP/IP game
performance on our web page.

SCENARIOS:

There are a number of pre-generated scenarios provided with the game in the
'\scenarios' directory.

*The first three, labeled "1Explore", "2Build", and "3Conquer", are
tutorials designed to get beginners up and running with the game. *The
"Faction v Faction" folder contains three scenarios pitting a faction
against its archenemy; these may be played as single-player or multiplayer
scenarios.

*The three folders beginning with "MP..." are designed as balanced
multiplayer scenarios with defined goals and short time limits. Try them out
for a shorter, sharp, fun multiplayer experience!

*The last scenario, "SP--7 PlayerA" puts the factions arrayed around a
central continent in a struggle for territory.

Enjoy,

The Firaxis Games Team

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I had a conversation some months back with Jason Coleman, Firaxis' Senior
Programmer, where he talked about the overwhelming importance of an entire
team's contribution to a game. At the time I agreed with him, but I only
fully realized what he meant once we were deep into Alien Crossfire. I had
an amazing experience working with everyone on this project, and it also
brought home how fortunate we are to have the kind of collaborative,
friendly, and open team environment here at Firaxis.

The lead programmer and lynchpin of the whole Crossfire effort, Chris Pine,
was the newest addition to the Firaxis programming team. Chris was full of
exceptional talent and promise, but there was some question as to whether we
had overextended ourselves (and him) by throwing him headlong into Brian's
code with little guidance and with his only professional experience
consisting of Alpha Centauri's report screens. Chris's schedule required him
to complete tasks at twice the estimated rate in order to have a prayer of
making our September ship date. The first month I watched, amazed, as he not
only met his goals, but exceeded them, allowing us to commit a team to the
expansion with full confidence of success.

Throughout this process, Greg Foertsch and Jerome Atherholt anchored the art
for all the additions: portraits, bases, icons, and all the other stuff
needed to fit the expansion into the game. Over time, Greg's exceptional
leadership and vision made him the natural choice as Art Lead on Alien
Crossfire. In addition to his organizational duties and oversight of all
things art, Greg lovingly crafted the new bases in the game. Greg also came
up with a ton of great game ideas during the design phase, many of which
were adopted wholesale for the final version. His partner in crime, Jerome
Atherholt, conceived and designed all the faction leader portraits, with the
same high quality and attention to detail he used on the original SMAC 7.
Jerome also found time from his new duties as Firaxis Art Manager to handle
many of the cool new map icons, including the Unity wreckage, the Spore
Launchers, and the Battle Ogres. He showed astounding patience in the face
of several 'group feedback sessions' on his initial designs, and the final
portraits are a testament to his exceptional painting skills.

Much of Alien Crossfire's detail and play balance came courtesy of Doug
Kaufman, a recent Firaxis hire but a 16-year game industry veteran. His
sagacious advice, support,  and encyclopedic knowledge of all things
game-related proved invaluable, and Crossfire is a much richer product as a
result. Doug was part of the original team on Alpha Centauri, as well as Sid
Meier's Civilization II, Sid Meier's Colonization, and far too many other
games to list here. Doug was instrumental in keeping the vision of Crossfire
focused. Not only did he offer outstanding ideas, but he always had the
wisdom to ask "What are we trying to accomplish with this feature?" And when
I would wander into his office and say something like "Uh...do you mind
rewriting all of script.txt to reflect an alien viewpoint," he was up for
the challenge. When those thankless writing chores were done, he also
hammered out the manual in record time.

Several other Firaxians made their mark felt on Crossfire by lending their
art skills in between other projects. Rising art star Brent Alleyne came up
with the great alien character design, and then implemented it in 3D. He
also worked out quite a few of the animations and other necessary art, and
has been one of the fastest learners I've worked with. Rarely has a new hire
fit so well into an existing team as Brent. Mike Bazzell, animator of the
units in the original Alpha Centauri, graciously lent many of his evenings
and weekends to the new unit components. And when Brent's final alien design
was just too darn cool to keep the human 'look and feel' of the original
units, Mike uncomplainingly went about redesigning most of the old chassis
and modules. And last, but certainly not least, Steven Chao upheld the
glorious Firaxis intern tradition of producing outstanding work over the
summer, and was rewarded with a permanent staff position. Steve undertook
all the new icons in the game, handled many interface chores, and designed
the alien scout ships seen in the opening.

Jeff Morris, our office champion of just about every game he tries, designed
and programmed the faction editor. After mastering the intricacies of the
JACKAL library, Jeff also co-ordinated our testing effort with the skill and
experience of his five years in the game industry. As if those tasks weren't
enough, he also handled quite a bit of miscellaneous programming, including
the install and autorun,  managed all disc duplication and distribution, and
kept our internal network running. He also kept track of our beta test team,
who provided some of the most valuable feedback of the whole process.

On the multimedia front, Producer Michael Ely, longtime friend and sounding
board, once again directed all the new movies and voiceovers in the game
with his cinematic eye and ear. Mike is an outstanding example of an
industry renaissance man, providing not only the movies, but also backstory,
blurbs, plot advice, and suggestions for avoiding cliché. He also penned the
new chapters in the web story seen at www.aliencrossfire.com. Somehow he
wedged all this in between his leadership duties on Sid Meier's Antietam and
the new, top-secret Sid project.

Dave Evans, the best all-around sound man in the industry, designed and
programmed all the sounds you hear in Crossfire, along with the ambient
music, movie effects, game sounds, and voice processing. Dave squeezed all
this in on a very tight schedule, even taking time to tutor me in the finer
points of field recording prior to a couple of Moxy Fròvous shows. Also
handling music chores for the movies was Jeff Briggs, our ever-versatile
CEO, President, and composer.

Last but not least on the development side were a pair of lifesavers: Brian
Reynolds and Senior Programmer Jason Coleman. Brian, of course, created the
original Alpha Centauri world and consented to let us play with it for a
while. Then, when time was at a premium, he stopped work on his OTHER
project to add in all the new missiles, the alien victory condition, and
some spruced-up AI. Jason helped out on several multiplayer and
library-related issues, also taking time away from his other projects. Many
thanks to both for their time and effort!

On the Electronic Arts side, we had outstanding support from the marketing,
production, and QA departments. Producer Hunter Smith kept us on the
semblance of a schedule, while Jonathan Harris and Chris Plummer whipped a
marketing program into shape. These three individuals possess an exceptional
grasp of games and the marketplace, and we were very lucky to be able to
work with them. Translations were headed up by two veterans from Alpha
Centauri, Christina Vollmer and Jean-Luc Chabrier. This pair stands head and
shoulders above all other translation teams I've ever worked with, for their
professionalism, commitment to quality, and technical aptitude. David
McCormick did an excellent job as QA Lead, ferreting out quite a few bugs
that were in the original product. He made the often arduous process of
playtesting from 3000 miles away go as smoothly as I could have imagined.
And of course we owe a huge debt to Bing Gordon, EA co-founder, Firaxis
booster, and Alpha Centauri fan, for his suggestions and support throughout
the entire design process.

Several other people at Firaxis supported or contributed directly to this
expansion, including Susan Meier, Master of Miscellaneous, Lindsay Riehl,
Director of Marketing and PR, Jennifer Bass, Director of Finance, Dan
Magaha, Webmaster, and Stephen Lee, web intern. And of course, to Sid Meier,
for teaching all of us how to make these god games in the first place!

In short, Alien Crossfire is a proud reflection of each team member's unique
talents and perspectives. Thanks to all of them for their time, creativity,
and good-natured personalities. By now this is a cliché for the gaming
industry, but I sincerely hope you have as much fun playing the game as we
had making it!
