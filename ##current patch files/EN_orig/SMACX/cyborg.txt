Those who join us need give up only half of their humanity--the illogical, 
ill-tempered, and disordered half, commonly thought of as 'right-brain' 
functioning. In exchange, the 'left-brain' capacities are increased to undreamed 
potential. The tendency of Biologicals to cling instead to their individual 
personalities can only be attributed to archaic evolutionary tendencies.
